            <p> Hello! My name is Huanying Yeh and I also go by Joy. I am an undergraduate electrical engineering
                student at Johns Hopkins University, currently a rising junior. I loved creating since I was little -
                studying engineering is a dream come true! I enjoy learning new technology, making design projects, and
                helping others. I aspire to be a robotics
                engineer, industrial designer, traveller,
                and much more.
